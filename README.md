## 👨‍🔬 About Me

I am a doctoral researcher working in the field of **Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) of infectious diseases**.  
My research focuses on the **development and psychometric validation of questionnaires** and on modeling the **structural relationships between knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, intention, and behavior** using advanced quantitative methods.

I primarily apply **Health Behavior Theories**—notably the **Health Belief Model (HBM)** and the **Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)**—and rigorously test them using **SEM, CFA, EFA, and IRT-informed approaches**.

## 🎓 Education

**PhD (Public Health / Epidemiology)** *(In Progress)*  
📌 Focus: Community-Based Surveillance of Infectious Diseases  
📌 Research Area: Knowledge, Attitudes, Perceptions, Intention, and Behavioral Likelihood  
📌 Methodology: Questionnaire Development, SEM, Psychometrics

## 🔬 Research Experience

### 📘 Doctoral Researcher — Community-Based Surveillance
**2024 – Present**

- Developed and validated the **KAPerception-CBS-ID questionnaire** for community representatives.
- Designed constructs aligned with **HBM** (perceived susceptibility, benefits, barriers, self-efficacy, cues to action).
- Integrated **TPB constructs** (attitude, subjective norms, intention) into the analytical framework.
- Conducted **EFA and CFA** to establish construct validity and reliability.
- Applied **Structural Equation Modeling (SEM)** with a large sample size (n = 470).
- Utilized **Item Response Theory (IRT)** concepts alongside CFA for scale refinement.
- Examined contextual effects using a **residency variable (Urban vs Rural)** in SEM.
